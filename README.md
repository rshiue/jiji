# jiji

A command line to query and print Jira issues in an Excel workbook.

Example:
```bash
# in terminal
jiji --query "project in (PRJ1, PRJ2) AND status = Open ORDER BY key ASC" --username robert@company.com --password [SECRET] --host https://jira.mycompany.com/rest/api/2/search --start_date_field customfield_10444 --end_date_field customfield_10445 --dest my_issue_report.xlsx
```

- Set up two custom fields of issue for start-date and end-date. The names of fields don't matter. Jiji only need to know the ``id of the field``

- Ensure you have access to the projects or filter you'll be querying.
